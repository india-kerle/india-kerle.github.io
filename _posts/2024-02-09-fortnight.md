I kicked off my 3-month sabbatical two weeks ago to Explosion AI and have been largely figuring out where I am in time and space with the work and the team. 

It's been a lovely introduction thus far: I've had coffee chats with the team and everyone has been really friendly and welcoming. I've also been getting to grips with standard workflows and tools and have already started working on small tasks, which is great. 

Off the bat, **two things** have already struck me: 

 üèóÔ∏è **What you're building informs how you build it.**

The role of data science in a product-oriented tech start up like Explosion AI is very different to a non-profit. At Nesta, methodologies fuel outputs like research papers, policy recommendations and prototypes. 

These types of outputs inform many of the technical decisions we make, from the way codebases are structured to what standards there are for merging into `dev`. Simply put, it can be overkill to build very robust, maintainable systems when the outputs are a one-off. 

Meanwhile, the story is, somewhat predictably, different at a product-orientated tech start up. There is much more of a focus on things like CI/CD, type checking and documentation. I've learned about tools like [`pyright`](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright), a standards-based static type checker, to ensure type compliance and I've focused more on testing. 

Long story short, I think its about **_being flexible, proportionate and having the tool box to adapt_** to meeting the needs of whatever outputs your delivering.

üëØ **Open source means taking seriously your community.**

Given Explosion's central position in the open source Python eco-system, I've already witnessed just how important engaging with and the wider community is. The team takes seriously meaningfully engaging with the community, from the considered responses to issues on [their support forums](https://support.prodi.gy/) to regular blog posts, [case studies](https://explosion.ai/blog/nesta-skills), tutorials and even [a page on their website](https://explosion.ai/_/category/universe) highlighting the community's use of spaCy and Prodigy. I can also image that **_the tight feedback loop is helpful for informing the development of their tools_**.

It's given me food for thought in my own work at Nesta and how we can best set up these feedback loops when building solutions like the [Skills Extractor](https://github.com/nestauk/ojd_daps_skills) or the [Green Jobs Explorer](https://github.com/nestauk/dap_prinz_green_jobs?tab=readme-ov-file#green-jobs-explorer). 


I'm looking forward to seeing how these initial thoughts develop over the next while and what else I learn.
